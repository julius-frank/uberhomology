# Ãœberhomology

This is a python script to calculate uberhomology of a simplicial complex.
To run, do the following:
1. Install python 3 
2. Save the file uberhomology.py 
3. Open your terminal
4. Navigate to the directory where the file is
5. Type `python3 uberhomology.py` (and hit enter) to run the program

The program then guides you through the process:
1. First, enter the number of vertices. (warning: It gets slow at around 10.)
2. Next, enter simplices: E.g., if you want to add a 2-simplex on the vertices 1,4 and 5, type `1,4,5` and hit enter.
3. You don't need to manually add all faces, the program does that.
4. If you're done, hit enter again.
